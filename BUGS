The following are known bugs and notable features gaps in the current
version of Aloofix;

- It's not thoroughly tested. Adding 'make check' is in process, as is
  checking ABIs.

- The buildstrap procedure needs to use a cross-compiler or something
  similar to LFS.

- Checking digital signatures of downloaded tarballs is not yet
  implemented.

- The root account uses /bin/ash for the shell. Do not change this to
  another shell. Issues with poweroff and reboot have been found when
  using /bin/bash as the root shell.

- The documentation is somewhat lean.

- The license tag mechanism isn't finished. Corrections to the license
  tags are gleefully accepted.

- The disk initialization portion of the installation script is
  horribly naive.
