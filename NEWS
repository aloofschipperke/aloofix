Changes in 0.9.0
================

* The Aloofix project has been rebooted. Versions prior to 0.9.0 are
  no longer supported.

* The Makefile mechanism has been replaced with shell scripts.

* Primary development is done on KVM. Other virtualization platforms,
  such as VMware, Virtualbox, and UML should work but have not been
  thoroughly tested on 0.9.0. Patches gleefully accepted.

* Some of the packages available in 0.8.x have been removed. Most will
  be added back at a later time.

* Version control has been moved from subversion to git.
