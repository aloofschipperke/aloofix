Aloofix is distributed as a build kit in source form. While a package
manager for binary packages is provided, Aloofix is not currently
distributed in source form and an initial bootstrapping (or
buildstrapping) procedure is required to create an environment capable
of creating binary packages.

This initial buildstrapping procedure proceeds in stages. An initial
build is done on a non-Aloofix system. This builds an installation
ISO, which is used to install a minimal Aloofix distro and toolchain
to a hard drive. This first instance is used to create a second
installation CD built from Aloofix which is then again installed on a
VM hard drive.  Once done with the initial installation, you will have
a running Aloofix instance which can be used as an Aloofix build
server and package server.

The document `docs/buildstrapping.txt` contains step by step
instructions for completing the initial buildstrapping procedure.

The buildstrapping procedure compiles each of the packages needed for
the final instance. The overall buildstraping process takes
approximately an hour using a 4-core KVM guest with 256MB of RAM on a
2.3GHz Intel i7-3610QM system. The buildstrapping procedure thankfully
only needs to be once. There should be no need to do it against once
the initial Aloofix instance has been created. Also, building all
packages once the buildstrap environment is done will take
approximately 1.5 hours on the previously mentioned VM.

The buildstrapping procedure is evolving with each release. Expect it
to improve over time. Things are still a bit rough around the
edges. Check out the `TODO` file for an indication of shortcomings and
plans.
